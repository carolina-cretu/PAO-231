/**
 * There are five silent philosophers (P1 – P5) sitting around a circular table, spending their lives eating and thinking.
 * <p>
 * There are five forks for them to share (1 – 5) and to be able to eat, a philosopher needs to have forks in both his hands.
 * After eating, he puts both of them down and then they can be picked by another philosopher who repeats the same cycle.
 * <p>
 * The goal is to come up with a scheme/protocol that helps the philosophers achieve their goal of eating
 * and thinking without getting starved to death.
